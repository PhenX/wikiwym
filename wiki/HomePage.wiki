= Introduction =

Wikiwym is wiki syntax parser, implemented in !JavaScript, which tries to reasonably imitate the Google Code wiki format.

*Code status:* early beta. Most of the core features work, but there are some features to add and some corner cases to check/fix.

*License:* MIT

*Primary Features:*

  * Fairly Small. The core parser lives in one file and has no external dependencies.
  * It is not based on regular expressions. For the most part it scans char-by-char, so it is more robust in handling things like nested markup (e.g. _*italicized bold*_) than regex-based implementations.
  * Can handle "most" Google Code wiki markup.  See [SupportedWikiSyntax] for what we believe works.
  * The main parser code has a one-class, one-function interface, so it's easy to use.

*Primary Misfeatures:*

  * Certain wiki markup is not yet supported. See [SupportedWikiSyntax].
  * "Inline" markup (bold, italics, etc. i.e. all markup which is not for block-level items) is only processed within a single line. i'm not 100% sure we have the same meaning of "end of line" as !GoCo does.
  * Nested lists aren't yet implemented.
  * Support for `<wiki:toc>` is not yet implemented.
  * There are not yet any configurable options. Use it as-is or hack it to suit.

=Ultra-mini HOWTO=

The source tree has several files, in various stages of completion. The core parser code is in [http://code.google.com/p/wikiwym/source/browse/trunk/lib/GoogleCodeWikiParser.js GoogleWikiCodeParser.js], and is used like this:

{{{
var g = GoogleWikiCodeParser();
var html = g.parse( " ... wiki markup code ..." );
}}}

The file [http://code.google.com/p/wikiwym/source/browse/trunk/lib/parser.js parser.js] uses the Prototype JS library to provide a as-you-type preview of wiki code. It is demonstrated at [http://wikiwym.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/index.html]. (Achtung: at the moment (20100422) parser.js uses a completely different parser implementation than `GoogleWikiCodeParser`, and they do not behave identically.)

There is another live demo, based on jQuery and the `GoogleWikiCodeParser` class, at: [http://wikiwym.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/index-jquery.html].
