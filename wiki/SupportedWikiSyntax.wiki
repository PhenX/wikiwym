= Introduction =

This page demonstrates the various wiki markup which is working (or believed to be working) in the [http://code.google.com/p/wikiwym/source/browse/trunk/lib/GoogleCodeWikiParser.js current parser code].

=Wiki-style Links=

Wiki-words are _not_ linked by default - only those in `[ThisSyntax]` or `[ThisSyntax label string]` are handled. e.g. [HomePage] gets linked but HomePage does not. Remote URLs are also handled only if they are bracketed (e.g. [http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice]).

=Source code blocks=

{{{
if( (i < 10) && (i > 1) ) {
    print("hi, world!");
}
}}}

=Lists=

Only single-level lists are currently supported.

  * Item 1 is _emphasized_.
  * Item 2 is *bold*.
  * Item 3 is *_emphasized bold_*.
  * Item is `backticked`.

  # Item 4 is ~~stricken~~.
  # Item 5 is ,,subscript,,.
  # Item 6 is ^superscript^.
  # Do `<backticks block parsing of <`?

=Tables=

|| cell 0,0 || ,,cell 1,0,, || ^cell 2,0^ ||
|| ~~*cell 0,1*~~ || ~~cell 1,1~~ || _cell 2,1_ ||
|| ^*cell 0,2*^ (LOL! !GoCo doesn't handle superscripted bold, but our parser does) || cell 1,2 || *cell 2,2* ||

=Missing=

  * Auto-IMG-tagging of certain links. (TODO)
  * ???
