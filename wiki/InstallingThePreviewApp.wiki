= Installing the Preview App =

[http://fossil.wanderinghorse.net/demos/wikiwym/ Our online previewer application] can be installed as follows...

==Requirements==

  * Our [http://code.google.com/p/wikiwym/source/checkout source code].
  * PHP5 with JSON support and the the so-called `fopen()` wrappers, which allow PHP to open remote URLs using `fopen()`.
  * It is untested on non-Apache servers and is known to not work on Windows servers (but _why_ is unknown).

= Setting up Apache =

If you run Apache/PHP locally then...

Add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` (or equivalent):

{{{
127.0.0.1 localhost <any local aliases> wikiwym
}}}

In your Apache configuration, add:

{{{
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAlias wikiwym
    DocumentRoot /path/to/wikiwym
</VirtualHost>
}}}

Restart Apache and then point your browser at `http://wikiwym/`.

If all goes well, you'll then have a running copy of the server and client.
